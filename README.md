# 🌟 Hey there! I'm **TuanKhoii**

I’m a curious learner who loves exploring how technology can turn ideas into something real.  
Coding, for me, is more than just writing lines of code — it’s about creating, experimenting, and learning along the way.  

I enjoy working on small projects, trying out new frameworks, and finding simple ways to solve interesting problems.  
Each project teaches me something new and keeps me motivated to grow as a developer.  

Outside of coding, I like discovering new things, improving my skills, and connecting with creative people.  
I believe progress comes one small step at a time — and I’m always ready for the next one.  

⭐ *"Keep learning, stay curious, and enjoy the journey."*
